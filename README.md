# Car Sales Analysis - RStudio Mini Project

This is a mini project written in R using RStudio, where we analyze the "mtcars" dataset to gain insights into car sales. The dataset contains various attributes of different car models, and we perform several tasks to explore and visualize the data. Let's go through each task and the corresponding analysis.

### Overview 📋

Welcome to the **Car Sales Analysis Mini-Project**, a data analysis and recommendation system built in R. This project aims to provide insights into car sales data, create visually appealing data visualizations, and offer personalized car recommendations using collaborative filtering.

### Features ✨

- **Data Analysis:** Dive into the world of car sales data to identify trends, patterns, and key insights related to various car models, sales volumes, and customer preferences.

- **Data Visualization:** Utilize the power of ggplot2 to create informative data visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and more, to present the analysis findings in an engaging manner.

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Implement a recommendation system using the recommenderlab package, suggesting cars based on users' preferences and historical interactions.

- **User Customization:** Personalize your car recommendations by specifying your preferences, and let the system generate tailored suggestions based on similar users' behaviors.

### How to Use 🛠️

1. **Clone or Download:** Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary R packages mentioned in the R script (`car_sales_analysis.R`).

3. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the R script (`car_sales_analysis.R`) in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

4. **Get Recommendations:** Check the console for the analysis results and personalized car recommendations.

### Dataset 📊

The project uses a sample car sales dataset, which is not included in the repository. However, you can easily replace it with your own car sales data for analysis.

## Dataset Description

The "mtcars" dataset is a built-in dataset in R, which contains data for various car models. It includes the following columns:

- `mpg`: Miles per gallon (Fuel efficiency)
- `cyl`: Number of cylinders
- `disp`: Displacement (Engine size)
- `hp`: Horsepower
- `drat`: Rear axle ratio
- `wt`: Weight (in thousands of pounds)
- `qsec`: Quarter mile time
- `vs`: V/S (Engine type: V-shaped or straight)
- `am`: Transmission type (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
- `gear`: Number of forward gears
- `carb`: Number of carburetors

### Tasks and Analysis 🔍

Below are the tasks performed in the analysis:

1. Explore the structure and summary of the dataset.

2. Calculate and visualize the average miles per gallon (mpg) for different car models.

3. Plot a bar chart showing the number of cylinders in different car models.

4. Find the car model with the highest and lowest horsepower.

5. Calculate the correlation between mpg and weight of the cars.

6. Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between mpg and weight.

7. Determine the most fuel-efficient car model based on mpg.

8. Calculate the average miles per gallon for cars with automatic and manual transmission.

9. Compare the average mpg between automatic and manual transmission cars using a bar chart.

## Conclusion

This mini-project provides a comprehensive analysis of the "mtcars" dataset, offering valuable insights into car sales. By examining the fuel efficiency, cylinder count, horsepower, transmission type, and weight, we gain a better understanding of the characteristics of different car models.
